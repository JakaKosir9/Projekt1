In the current Pokemon TCG Pocket meta, one card that’s dividing players is Misty, a Supporter card for water-type decks with a high-risk, high-reward mechanic. Misty lets players attach multiple energy cards to a water-type Pokemon by flipping a coin until they get tails, enabling powerful attacks faster than usual. The card’s reliance on coin flips makes it inconsistent: it can either be extremely powerful or entirely ineffective. Frustration with the card is growing, especially in the context of a water-type event, where lucky players can pull off devastating attacks on turn one, bypassing the game’s usual restrictions.

On the Pokemon TCG Pocket subreddit, players have proposed adjustments to Misty, like capping the number of coin flips or restricting energy distribution to make her less luck-based. Some players are even joking that Misty’s coin flips are rigged due to the card’s unpredictable results.

With player frustration high, the developers may eventually tweak Misty, but no changes are confirmed. Meanwhile, many players are opting for more stable deck options, focusing on popular Charizard and Mewtwo builds, while steering clear of luck-reliant cards like Misty.
